# ft_printf

## Description:

This repository contains an implementation of the ft_printf function in C. ft_printf replicates the behavior of the standard C library function printf and provides formatted output functionality for various data types.

## Key Features:

Implementation of ft_printf to handle format specifiers like %d, %s, %c, %x, %p, etc.
Support for handling various data types (integers, strings, characters, etc.) along with their corresponding format specifiers.
Handling of optional flags for formatting output (e.g., padding, precision, width) similar to the original printf function.
A robust implementation demonstrating string manipulation, memory management, and the use of variadic functions (va_list, va_start, va_arg, va_end).
## Purpose:

Created as a programming assignment or project to deepen understanding of string formatting and output in C.
Aims to replicate the behavior and functionalities of the standard C library function printf.
Demonstrates proficiency in low-level programming concepts such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and variadic functions.
## Usage:

Clone the repository and compile the provided code using a C compiler.
Utilize ft_printf in C projects for formatted output functionalities.
## Note:

This repository is a project assignment and may contain solutions specific to course requirements.
Contributions, improvements, or suggestions are welcome.
